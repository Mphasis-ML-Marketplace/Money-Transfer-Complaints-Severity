Consumer complaint narrative
"I had posted an ad on XXXX trying to sell my table and chairs, someone actually seemed interested and sent a check for XXXX . When I received the check I deposited into my mobile Wells Fargo account. This was on XX/XX/21 The check went through the next day with no issues. The person that issued the check said to pay movers through XXXX XXXX with the check that Wells Fargo cleared on XX/XX/21 an amount of XXXX dollars. So I did. A couple of days later he texts my phone saying they are going to back out from the deal and wont pick up the table and chairs I had listed on XXXX. And wanted me to XXXX him XXXX $ from my account to his zelle email he provided. Fast forward to today XX/XX/21 Wells Fargo had not only overdrawn my account by XXXX $ but theyve have also decided to return the check today instead of actually holding it when it was deposited on XX/XX/21. Now Im negative in my account have no money to help pay for things my child needs. And I am feeling helpless and cant seem to get justice for someone trying to scam me into giving me a fraudulent check in the first place."
"Sent an international wire transfer from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Sequence # XXXX ) for {$100000.00} ( QRN # XXXX ( transaction number ) ) to an account ( XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX XXXX, using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as the intermediary. The recepient account company name has since changed ( XXXX, now XXXX ), even though they still regularly receive payment using the previous name. The transfer agent told receiving company representative that the wire would be returned so it could be re-submitted with new name. They used JP Morgan as the intermediary bank on the return wire ( XXXX case number ). Both XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX say that there is nothing they can do to trace the return wire, as it's stuck with JP Morgan. As the intermediary bank, neither the sender nor the recipient is a JP Morgan customer, and each bank is pointing at another."
"On XX/XX/XXXX, Paypal took {$280.00} from my Paypal account and they can not explain why. I have called 16 times and asked for managers and supervisors over the past month and get different answers each time I call. They are trying to link it to a XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, who reserved our house back in XX/XX/XXXX. She paid a deposit on my Paypal account with a XXXX XXXX Credit Card in XX/XX/XXXX. Then she cancelled a few months later. We were out of the country at the time and could not refund her from my Paypal account because there were no funds in it at the time ; so we refunded her through my husband 's Paypal account ( XXXX XXXX ). When XXXX didn't get her refund right away, she filed a dispute with XXXX XXXX, but then got the funds in a few days and cancelled the dispute the next day. Nearly 4 weeks after my husband paid her, Paypal took the funds from my account and told me they put it in XXXX 's Paypal account. For several weeks she looked for the credit and it never came. We have been in constant contact with her regarding this issue and she is also quite frustrated with Paypal who gives her different stories every time she calls too. She stated and proved to us and Paypal by sending a screen shot of her account that she never received the funds from Paypal. Also she sent to them and us proof that she got the refund from my husbands Paypal account and was not owed any money any longer. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, Paypal told XXXX they sent the funds to her credit card by a "" forced refund '' and that it would show up on her credit card statement by XX/XX/XXXX. It never did show up on her statement. Meanwhile Paypal told me they were "" holding '' the funds to see what XXXX XXXX would do with the dispute. XXXX sent them documentation proof that XXXX had cancelled the dispute. Each time one of us tries to refer to the others Paypal account, Paypal tell us they can not discuss anything with her or us since the other party is not on the phone and they keep telling me the same that they could not discuss anything since XXXX or my husband was on the phone and told him the same when he called about his payment to XXXX. Now, XX/XX/XXXX, Paypal claims that XXXX took the money from them because of the dispute and that they took it from me to recover their funds and told me to dispute it with my husband 's bank since he paid her from Paypal through his credit union. The credit union is confused and will not refund my husband because Paypal owes us the money. On XX/XX/2018, Paypal refuses to refund the money they took out of my Paypal account and I see no recourse for getting my money back. I have done research on the internet and found hundreds of similar and worse stories about Paypal. Seems no one is really regulating them."
